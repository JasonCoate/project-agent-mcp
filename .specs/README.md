# Specification Workflow System

This directory contains our specification workflow system, inspired by modern development practices for bridging the gap between product requirements and technical implementation.

## Structure

Each feature specification follows a structured workflow:

```
.specs/
├── feature-name/
│   ├── user-stories.md      # User stories and acceptance criteria
│   ├── architecture.md      # Technical architecture and implementation
│   ├── implementation.md    # Implementation plan with trackable tasks
│   ├── testing-strategy.md  # Comprehensive testing approach
│   └── context.md          # Project context and decisions
└── templates/              # Templates for new specifications
```

## Workflow Phases

1. **User Stories Phase**: Define user stories and acceptance criteria in structured format
2. **Architecture Phase**: Document technical architecture, sequence diagrams, and implementation considerations
3. **Implementation Planning**: Break down work into discrete, trackable tasks with clear descriptions
4. **Testing Strategy**: Define comprehensive testing approach including unit, integration, and E2E testing
5. **Execution Phase**: Track progress as tasks are completed with AI-assisted workflow management

## Key Features

- **Markdown-based Task Tracking**: Tasks are managed as markdown checklists with AI assistance
- **Phased Workflow**: Each phase must be completed before moving to the next
- **AI Integration**: Automatic task completion tracking and progress summaries
- **Context Preservation**: All decisions and changes are logged for future reference
- **MCP Integration**: Full integration with our Model Context Protocol server

## Usage

To create a new specification:

1. Use the MCP tool `create_spec_workflow` to generate the initial structure
2. Fill out user-stories.md with user stories and acceptance criteria
3. Complete architecture.md with technical architecture
4. Generate implementation.md with implementation plan
5. Define testing-strategy.md with comprehensive testing approach
6. Execute tasks with AI-assisted tracking

## Templates

Standardized templates ensure consistency across all specifications and make it easy to get started with new features.
