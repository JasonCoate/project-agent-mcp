## Memory Types

| Type                 | Purpose               | When to Use          |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| `session_context`    | Store session results | End of work sessions |
| `knowledge_snapshot` | Comprehensive state   | Major milestones     |
| `decision`           | Individual decisions  | Important choices    |
| `note`               | General information   | Ongoing observations |
| `issue`              | Problems found        | Bug reports          |
| `milestone`          | Project milestones    | Achievement markers  |

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do

- Start sessions with `retrieve_relevant_context`
- End sessions with `store_session_context`
- Include reasoning in decisions
- Use specific, descriptive queries
- Create snapshots at milestones
- Document alternatives considered

### ‚ùå Don't

- Store vague or generic information
- Skip context retrieval at session start
- Forget to include next steps
- Use overly broad queries
- Store duplicate information
- Ignore retrieved context

## Common Patterns

### New Feature

```
retrieve_relevant_context ‚Üí plan ‚Üí implement ‚Üí store_session_context
```

### Bug Fix

```
query_project_knowledge ‚Üí investigate ‚Üí fix ‚Üí store_session_context
```

### Code Review

```

```

### Architecture Decision

```
query_project_knowledge ‚Üí analyze ‚Üí decide ‚Üí create_knowledge_snapshot
```

### Refactoring

## Troubleshooting

| Problem            | Solution                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| No context found   | Check project_id, use broader terms  |
| Too much context   | Use filters, specific queries        |
| Irrelevant results | Improve storage quality, be specific |
| Performance slow   | Limit results, use time ranges       |
| Missing decisions  | Include reasoning when storing       |
| Outdated info      | Regular cleanup, update snapshots    |

## Tips for LLMs With Thinking Capabilities

1. **Leverage compound intelligence** - Combine retrieved context with deep reasoning for superior decisions
2. **Analyze patterns across time** - Use historical data to identify trends and evolution patterns
3. **Synthesize complex insights** - Merge current analysis with accumulated project wisdom
4. **Make strategic decisions** - Use comprehensive context for long-term architectural planning
5. **Cross-reference implementations** - Compare current approach with historical solutions
6. **Build on previous reasoning** - Extend and refine earlier analytical work
7. **Create knowledge synthesis** - Generate new insights from combined historical and current data
8. **Perform deep contextual analysis** - Use thinking capabilities to extract maximum value from retrieved context

## Tips for LLMs Without Thinking

1. **Always retrieve context first** - Don't start work without understanding previous decisions
2. **Store everything important** - Decisions, insights, code changes, next steps
3. **Use specific queries** - Include technical terms and context
4. **Create regular snapshots** - Capture comprehensive understanding
5. **Include reasoning** - Always explain why decisions were made
6. **Plan next steps** - Help future sessions continue smoothly
7. **Review retrieved context** - Actually use the information provided
8. **Update understanding** - Modify approach based on stored knowledge

This memory system transforms stateless interactions into stateful, context-aware development sessions for all types of LLMs.
