# N8N Integration with Project Agent MCP Server

## üéâ Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED & TESTED

**Last Updated:** July 26, 2025  
**Integration Status:** ‚úÖ Production Ready

This guide explains how to integrate N8N workflows with the Project Agent MCP Server for automated project monitoring and management.

## Overview

The Project Agent MCP Server includes four fully functional N8N workflows that provide automated monitoring, progress tracking, specification validation, and direct MCP integration:

1. ‚úÖ **Project Monitor** - Database-level monitoring of active projects
2. ‚úÖ **Progress Tracker** - Webhook-based task progress tracking
3. ‚úÖ **Spec Validator** - Specification consistency validation
4. ‚úÖ **MCP Integration** - Direct integration with MCP server tools

### üöÄ Quick Demo

Run the integration demo to see everything working:

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

This demonstrates:

- MCP server communication
- Project progress analysis
- Webhook simulation
- Database integration
- Memory logging

## Prerequisites

- N8N installed and running (`n8n start` command should be active)
- Project Agent MCP Server built and functional
- SQLite database with project data

## Workflow Descriptions

### 1. Project Monitor (`project-monitor.json`)

**Purpose**: Monitors active projects and identifies issues requiring attention.

**Features**:

- Runs every 4 hours via cron schedule
- Queries active projects from the database
- Analyzes project statistics (task counts, progress, blocked tasks)
- Logs alerts for projects with issues
- Identifies bottlenecks and overdue tasks

**Triggers**: Scheduled (every 4 hours)

### 2. Progress Tracker (`progress-tracker.json`)

**Purpose**: Tracks project progress in real-time via webhooks.

**Features**:

- Webhook endpoint: `/progress-update`
- Calculates overall project progress and velocity
- Detects progress trends and concerns
- Logs milestone achievements
- Alerts on stalled or problematic projects

**Triggers**: Webhook (POST to `/progress-update`)

### 3. Spec Validator (`spec-validator.json`)

**Purpose**: Validates project specifications for consistency and completeness.

**Features**:

- Webhook endpoint: `/spec-change`
- Checks for required specification types
- Validates priority distribution
- Identifies outdated specifications
- Logs validation results and issues

**Triggers**: Webhook (POST to `/spec-change`)

### 4. MCP Integration (`mcp-integration.json`) ‚≠ê **NEW**

**Purpose**: Direct integration with MCP server tools for comprehensive automation.

**Features**:

- Uses MCP CLI to call server tools directly
- Runs every 6 hours via cron schedule
- Fetches projects using `list_projects` tool
- Analyzes progress using `analyze_progress` tool
- Logs alerts using `add_context_note` tool
- Sends notifications for projects needing attention

**Triggers**: Scheduled (every 6 hours)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Import Workflows into N8N

1. Open N8N interface (usually `http://localhost:5678`)
2. Go to **Workflows** ‚Üí **Import from File**
3. Import each workflow file:
   - `project-monitor.json`
   - `progress-tracker.json`
   - `spec-validator.json`
   - `mcp-integration.json`

### 2. Configure Database Connections

All workflows are pre-configured with the correct database path:

```
${PROJECT_ROOT}/mcp-server/data/project-agent.db
```

**Note**: The `${PROJECT_ROOT}` environment variable should be set to your project's root directory path.

### 3. Activate Workflows

1. Open each imported workflow
2. Click **Activate** to enable the workflow
3. Verify the schedule triggers are working

## Testing the Integration

### Test MCP Integration Workflow

1. **Manual Execution**:
   - Open the "MCP Integration" workflow
   - Click **Execute Workflow** to run manually
   - Check the execution log for results

2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Fetches active projects from MCP server
   - Analyzes each project's progress
   - Logs alerts for projects with issues
   - Sends notifications for attention-needed projects

### Test Webhook Workflows

1. **Progress Tracker Test**:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5678/webhook/progress-update \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"project_id": "your-project-id"}'
   ```

2. **Spec Validator Test**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5678/webhook/spec-change \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"project_id": "your-project-id"}'
   ```

## Integration Benefits

### Automated Monitoring

- **Continuous oversight** of all active projects
- **Early detection** of issues and bottlenecks
- **Automated alerts** for projects needing attention

### Real-time Updates

- **Webhook integration** for immediate progress tracking
- **Live specification validation** on changes
- **Instant notifications** for critical issues

### MCP Server Integration

- **Direct tool access** via MCP CLI
- **Consistent data handling** through MCP protocols
- **Enhanced functionality** beyond database queries

### Comprehensive Logging

- **Centralized memory log** for all automation events
- **Structured metadata** for analysis and reporting
- **Audit trail** for automated decisions

## Workflow Customization

### Adjusting Schedule Frequency

Modify the cron expressions in schedule triggers:

- **Every hour**: `0 * * * *`
- **Every 30 minutes**: `*/30 * * * *`
- **Daily at 9 AM**: `0 9 * * *`

### Adding Notification Channels

Extend workflows with additional nodes:

- **Email notifications** (SMTP node)
- **Slack alerts** (Slack node)
- **Discord webhooks** (HTTP Request node)
- **Teams notifications** (Microsoft Teams node)

### Custom Analysis Logic

Modify the Function nodes to add:

- **Custom thresholds** for alerts
- **Project-specific rules** for monitoring
- **Advanced analytics** and reporting

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Check Workflow Execution

1. **Execution History**:
   - View past executions in N8N interface
   - Check for errors or failed nodes
   - Review execution times and performance

2. **Database Logs**:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM memory_log
   WHERE event_type IN ('issue', 'milestone', 'validation')
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```

3. **MCP Server Logs**:
   - Check console output from MCP server
   - Monitor for CLI execution errors
   - Verify tool responses

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Errors**:
   - Verify database file path
   - Check file permissions
   - Ensure SQLite is accessible

2. **MCP CLI Errors**:
   - Verify MCP server is built (`npm run build`)
   - Check CLI tool installation
   - Ensure correct working directory

3. **Webhook Failures**:
   - Verify N8N webhook URLs
   - Check HTTP request format
   - Ensure proper JSON payload

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Project Environments

For managing multiple project environments:

1. Create environment-specific workflows
2. Use different database paths
3. Configure separate notification channels

### Integration with External Tools

Extend workflows to integrate with:

- **Jira** for issue tracking
- **GitHub** for repository monitoring
- **Confluence** for documentation updates
- **Analytics platforms** for reporting

### Custom MCP Tool Integration

Add new workflow nodes that call additional MCP tools:

- `create_task` for automated task creation
- `update_spec` for specification updates
- `search_context` for intelligent project search

## Conclusion

The N8N integration transforms the Project Agent MCP Server from a reactive tool into a proactive project management system. With automated monitoring, real-time tracking, and intelligent alerting, teams can stay ahead of project issues and maintain optimal productivity.

The combination of database-level monitoring and direct MCP tool integration provides both performance and functionality, ensuring comprehensive project oversight without manual intervention.
