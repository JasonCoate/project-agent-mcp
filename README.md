## 🎯 What It Does

text

```text
👤 You: "Create a task management app with React"

🤖 AI Assistant: "I've created the 'Task Management App' project with initial 
                 specifications for user authentication and task management.
                 
                 Next steps: Should I start with the authentication system?"

👤 You: "Add a calendar view for tasks"  

🤖 AI Assistant: "I notice from our project context that we should add technical 
                 specifications for the calendar feature first. Let me create 
                 those, then implement the calendar view..."
```

The system automatically tracks your project, validates specifications, monitors progress, and provides intelligent steering recommendations through any MCP-compatible AI assistant.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```text
[AI Assistants] ↔ [MCP Server] ↔ [SQLite Database]
                      ↕              ↕
              [N8N Workflows] → [Intelligent Steering]
                      ↕
              [Webhook Endpoints] → [Real-time Monitoring]
```

**Components:**
