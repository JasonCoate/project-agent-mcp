# Project Agent

**AI-powered project management with MCP server integration and N8N automation**

A self-hosted project management system that integrates with AI assistants through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Manage specifications, track progress, and automate workflows locally.  

## Quick Start

### üöÄ Recommended Installation

**One installation, use for all projects**:

1. **Clone and setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone <this-repo> ~/tools/project-agent
   cd ~/tools/project-agent
   ./scripts/setup-shared.sh  # Installs dependencies
   ```

2. **Start the MCP server**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/tools/project-agent/mcp-server
   npm run build
   npm start  # Keep running in background
   ```

3. **Configure your AI assistant** to use `~/tools/project-agent/mcp-server`
   - See [Quick Start Guide](docs/QUICKSTART.md) for detailed setup

4. **Create projects anywhere**:
   ```bash
   mkdir my-awesome-app && cd my-awesome-app
   # Then in your AI assistant:
   "Create a new project called 'my-awesome-app' for a React web application"
   ```

### Alternative: Manual Setup

```bash
git clone <this-repo> ~/tools/project-agent
cd ~/tools/project-agent/mcp-server
npm install
npm run build
npm start  # Keep running in background
```

**The agent automatically creates**:
   - `.specs/` folder with project specifications
   - Feature directories with conventional commit prefixes (e.g., `1-feat-authentication/`)
   - Project-specific organization under `.specs/project-name/`
   - Task lists and workflow phases
   - Progress tracking and checkpoints

## Testing

```bash
# Test the integration
npm run test:integration
```

## How It Works

The system provides project context to AI assistants through MCP, enabling them to:
- Create planning-first workflows with conversational interfaces
- Track project specifications and requirements with real-time synchronization
- Monitor task progress with plain English summaries and automated updates
- Maintain project history and decisions with checkpoint validation
- Store session context and retrieve relevant information
- Create knowledge snapshots for complex projects
- Query project knowledge with natural language
- Validate specification consistency and phase completion
- Provide bidirectional sync between markdown files and database

## Compatible Tools

- **Cursor AI** - MCP integration with project context
- **Claude Desktop** - Native MCP server support
- **Continue.dev** - VS Code extension with MCP tools
- **Trae IDE** - Built-in MCP server integration
- **Gemini CLI** - Command-line AI with MCP support
- **Universal CLI Client** - Included interface (`clients/universal-mcp-client.ts`)

## N8N Workflows

- **Project Monitor** - Automated project health monitoring
- **Progress Tracker** - Real-time task progress tracking via webhooks
- **Spec Validator** - Specification consistency validation
- **MCP Integration** - Direct MCP server tool integration
